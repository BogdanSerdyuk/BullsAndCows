This is the *Bulls and Cows* project I made myself.

This program is a game, where the player has to guess a secret code generated by the program. The program prompts the user to input the length of the secret code and the number of possible symbols that can be used to generate the code. The code is then generated randomly and the game begins.

During each turn, the player inputs a guess for the code, and the program responds with a grade indicating how many bulls and cows were in the guess. A bull is a correct guess of a symbol in the correct position, while a cow is a correct guess of a symbol in the wrong position. The player keeps guessing until they guess the secret code correctly.

The program contains six classes: Application, Code, CodeException, Main, ValidatedUserInput and Grade. Application is the main class that contains the game loop and prompts the user for input. Code generates the secret code and checks the player's guess for bulls and cows. CodeException is a custom exception class used to handle errors related to generating the code. Grade is a class used to represent the grade given by the program for each guess, and contains the number of bulls and cows in the guess.
